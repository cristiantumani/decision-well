    question: "What is Corteza?",
    answer:
      "Corteza is a team memory tool for product teams. It captures your team's decisions, context, and reasoning — from Slack, meetings, docs, and more — and makes them searchable with AI. Instead of digging through threads or re-litigating old debates, anyone on your team can ask a question and get an instant answer with full context.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Corteza different from Notion or Confluence?",
    answer:
      "Notion and Confluence are great for documentation you intentionally write. Corteza is for capturing decisions as they happen, in the flow of work, without switching to another tool. You can log from Slack, the web dashboard, or a browser extension — wherever the decision is being made. Search is also fundamentally different: Corteza uses AI to understand what you're asking, not just match keywords.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Corteza work without Slack?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can log decisions directly from the Corteza web dashboard or the browser extension — no Slack required. Slack is one of the capture methods we support, but it's not a dependency. You can try the product today without any login at app.corteza.app/demo.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI search work?",
    answer:
      "When you ask a question, Corteza uses semantic search to find the most relevant decisions — even if you don't use the exact words from when the decision was logged. Then a language model synthesises a conversational answer, citing the specific decisions it drew from. It works like asking a knowledgeable teammate, not querying a database.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does setup take?",
    answer:
      "Under two minutes. Sign up, and your team can start logging decisions immediately — from the dashboard, the browser extension, or Slack. There's no data migration, no onboarding call required, and no credit card needed during the beta.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I try it before adding it to Slack?",
    answer:
      "Yes — the demo at app.corteza.app/demo lets you explore a fully-loaded team memory with 25 real decisions from a fictional company. You can search, ask questions, and see exactly how the AI responds. No login required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my team's data private?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your workspace's decisions are only accessible to members of your Slack workspace. Corteza uses workspace-level isolation — no data is shared between organisations. We use industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest, and we do not train AI models on your team's data.",
